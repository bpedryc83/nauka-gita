            <p>
                I've paid my dues
                Time after time
                I've done my sentence
                But committed no crime
                And bad mistakes
                I've made a few
                I've had my share of sand
                Kicked in my face
                But I've come through
                And we mean to go on and on and on and on
                We are the champions, my friends
                And we'll keep on fighting till the end
                We are the champions
                We are the champions
                No time for losers
                'Cause we are the champions of the World
            </p>
