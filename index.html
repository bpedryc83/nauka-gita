            <h2>We Are the Champions</h2>
            <h5>Composed by: Freddie Mercury</h5>
            <p>
                I've paid my dues<br>
                Time after time<br>
                I've done my sentence<br>
                But committed no crime<br>
                And bad mistakes<br>
                I've made a few<br>
                I've had my share of sand<br>
                Kicked in my face<br>
                But I've come through<br>
                And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
                We are the champions, my friends<br>
                And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
                We are the champions<br>
                We are the champions<br>
                No time for losers<br>
                'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>
                here is a change
            </p>
